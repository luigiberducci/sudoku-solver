# Sudoku Solver

Project for the course of "Programmazione di sistemi multicore", developed during the third year of university. It was developed with classmates Angelo Di Mambro and Karim Mejri.
This is an implementation of an experimental tool (it has no GUI), which explore exaustively the solutions space of a Sudoku 9x9 starting from an incomplete grid. The goal is parallelize the work (the solution space is huge) and for this reason we decided to use the paradigm ForkJoin.
The experimental phase is reported in "relazione.pdf" and in that document are reported details about implementation and strategy adopted.
